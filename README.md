# dotfiles
standard .dotfiles configuration for a standard person like me!

## How this works
This dotfiles repo is managed using [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm), a management suite specifically made for storing dotfiles.

*Note*: My `ncmpcpp` config uses `azlyrics` in its `lyrics_fetcher` field which may be non-functional on your version and lead to zero output. I complied `ncmpcpp` from [source](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp), adding [this pull request](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp/pull/544)'s additions to make it functional again.
